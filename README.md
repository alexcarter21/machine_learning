# machine_learning
Machine learning code using pytorch. 

This code is originally based off a workshop (pytorch.py) using the FashionMNIST dataset. The workshop provided a basic outline of the code, but this has been heavily edited by me to improve the model and code structure (e.g. different optimisers, more layers, more plots to visualise the fits).

pytorch_pupil.py is based off pytorch.py beyond the workshop, using my own real life data (not included here). This wasn't really an ideal dataset for machine learning as quite small so have also applied bootstrapping to the data.
